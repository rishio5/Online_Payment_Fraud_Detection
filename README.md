Online Payment Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent online payment transactions. Utilizing Python and various libraries, the model analyzes transaction data to classify activities as fraudulent or legitimate, thereby enhancing security in digital payment systems.

Dataset
The dataset comprises transaction records with the following features:

step: Time unit indicator

type: Transaction type

amount: Transaction amount

nameOrg: Sender's account

oldbalanceOrg: Sender's balance before transaction

newbalanceOrg: Sender's balance after transaction

nameDest: Receiver's account

oldbalanceDest: Receiver's balance before transaction

newbalanceDest: Receiver's balance after transaction

isFraud: Target variable (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraudulent)

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for data analysis and model development

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy: Numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and preprocessing tools

Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and correlations

Modeling: Training various machine learning models to detect fraud

Conclusion
This project provides a practical approach to detecting online payment fraud using machine learning. By following the steps outlined, one can develop a model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions, thereby contributing to the security of digital payment systems.
